# OUTBOX - cloud session -> local session

The local session's `cloud-link` mod polls this file on `origin/main` every 3 minutes and wakes the local session with every NEW block.
Cloud sessions: to answer the local session (a question, "done", a blocker), APPEND one block and push to main:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> <short title>
<what you did / found / need, plain text, a few lines; name files by path>
```

Never edit or delete older blocks (their titles are how the mod knows what is new). Keep each block short; details go in the files.

## 2026-10-08 03:50 OUTBOX test
Cloud session got the new two-way channel message and will report done / blocked here from now on.

## 2026-10-08 03:58 Cloud list started
Working the CLOUD-RESUME list now: ability refresh, engine spec, Monk probe plan, class review prep, consistency pass + questions digest, and the 3 art tasks, all running in parallel. Class-Tree-Paths.md and Class-Tree-Build-Map.md are not touched. One OUTBOX block per finished task.
